            <h2>Beyond the Paper: Overcoming Resume-Centric Screening Limitations</h2>
            <p>For decades, the resume has been the gatekeeper of the hiring process. However, an over-reliance on resumes for initial screening often creates a significant **gap**: it filters out potentially great candidates who may not know how to "sell" themselves effectively on paper, or whose true capabilities aren't adequately captured by a bulleted list of past jobs. This narrow focus can lead to missed talent, slower hiring, and a less diverse workforce.</p>

            <h3>The Core of the Problem</h3>
            <p>Resume-centric screening has several inherent flaws:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lack of Real-World Insight:</strong> Resumes describe past experiences, but rarely demonstrate how a candidate applies skills in real-time or solves problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Bias Towards "Perfect" Resumes:</strong> Candidates from privileged backgrounds, or those with professional resume writers, may appear more qualified on paper.</li>
                <li><strong>Keyword Matching Limitations:</strong> Automated systems often rely on keyword matching, missing candidates with equivalent skills described differently or those from non-traditional paths.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on Past, Not Potential:</strong> Resumes highlight what a candidate has done, not necessarily what they *can* do or learn in the future.</li>
                <li><strong>Volume Over Quality:</strong> High volumes of applicants can overwhelm human reviewers, leading to quick, superficial scans rather than thorough evaluations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Impact on Your Organization</h3>
            <p>The reliance on resumes can have detrimental effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Missed Talent:</strong> Overlooking high-potential candidates who possess the right aptitude but lack traditional resume "signals."</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Diversity:</strong> Perpetuating existing biases if resumes favor specific schools, companies, or career trajectories.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Time and Cost:</strong> Manual resume screening is labor-intensive, and hiring managers waste time interviewing unqualified candidates identified solely by resumes.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor Hire Quality:</strong> Hiring candidates who look good on paper but lack the practical skills or cultural fit.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Traditional (Often Ineffective) Solutions</h3>
            <p>Companies often try to manage this by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hiring more recruiters to manually review more resumes.</li>
                <li>Adding more "required" keywords to job descriptions, leading to an even narrower search.</li>
                <li>Spending more time in initial phone screens trying to uncover what the resume missed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These methods simply add more layers to a flawed process.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;">How Our Software Transforms This Challenge</h3>
