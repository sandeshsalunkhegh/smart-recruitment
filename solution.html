                <h2 class="section-title">1. No-Resume, Skill-First Hiring: Empowering Candidates</h2>
                <p>We've redesigned the candidate experience to highlight genuine ability over historical job titles. Candidates no longer upload generic resumes; instead, they engage with a dynamic system that illuminates their true potential.</p>
                <h4>Approach Recap:</h4>
                <ul class="solution-list">
                    <li><strong>No Resumes:</strong> We eliminate traditional resumes, focusing entirely on demonstrated skills and capabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Personalized Journeys:</strong> Candidates select roles/companies of interest, and our platform recommends tailored courses and assessments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Objective Scoring:</strong> Scores are precisely calculated based on recruiter-defined skill weightage for each role.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pre-Qualified Matches:</strong> Recruiters receive a curated list of pre-qualified candidates based on their genuine role-fit, not just paper qualifications.</li>

                    <div class="solution-card">
                        <h4>âœ… Smart Role Profiler</h4>
                        <p>Candidates complete an interactive questionnaire about their interests, strengths, preferred work type, and culture. Our AI maps this data to best-fit roles they might not have considered, helping them discover their true career direction.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">3. Ensuring Assessment Integrity: The Dual-Score System & Advanced Anti-Cheating Framework</h2>
                <p>To ensure the credibility and fairness of every assessment, our platform employs a sophisticated dual-score system and a robust anti-cheating framework. This approach is designed to be cheat-resistant, fair for honest candidates, and low-friction enough to not compromise the user experience.</p>
                <h4>Dual-Score Concept:</h4>
                <ul class="solution-list">
                    <li><strong>Skill Assessment Score (SAS):</strong> Based purely on a candidate's performance in assessments, weighted by recruiter-defined importance (technical, behavioral, etc.). This is the primary score for skill evaluation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fraud Mapping Score (FMS):</strong> A hidden score (0-100) visible only to recruiters that reflects the likelihood of cheating or fraudulent activity during assessments.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Dimensions of Fraud Mapping Score (FMS):</h4>
                <ul class="solution-list">
                    <li><strong>Behavioral Consistency:</strong> Analyzes whether the candidate's test behavior is human-like. Detected via AI-based activity monitoring (pauses, rapid switching, irregular clicks). <em>Penalty Weight: Medium.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Tab/Window Switch Frequency:</strong> Tracks how often a candidate switches out of the test window. Detected via Browser behavior monitoring. <em>Penalty Weight: High.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Copy/Paste Detection:</strong> Looks for pasted content during assessments. Detected via Clipboard activity capture, typing pattern mismatch. <em>Penalty Weight: High.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Impersonation Detection:</strong> Verifies identity during video-based tasks or test-taking. Detected via Face ID match, typing biometric profile, liveness detection. <em>Penalty Weight: High.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>IP & Device Consistency:</strong> Detects test attempts from unfamiliar or multiple devices/locations. Detected via IP address logging, device fingerprinting. <em>Penalty Weight: Medium.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Language Style Anomaly:</strong> If essay-type answers drastically differ from profile or practice logs. Detected via NLP anomaly detection, stylometry. <em>Penalty Weight: Low-Medium.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Time-to-Answer Anomalies:</strong> Answers completed suspiciously fast or slow based on question complexity. Detected via Adaptive test engine tracks average speed per question. <em>Penalty Weight: Medium.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Screen Recording/Remote Tool Use:</strong> Detects use of remote-control or screen-sharing tools (with user consent for monitoring). Detected via Background process monitoring. <em>Penalty Weight: High.</em></li>
                </ul>
