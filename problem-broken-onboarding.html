            <h2>The First 90 Days: Fixing a Broken Onboarding Process</h2>
            <p>Hiring the right candidate is only half the battle. Even when the recruitment process successfully identifies and secures top talent, a **broken onboarding process** can severely undermine that effort. This creates a critical **gap**: poor onboarding leads to early attrition, disengaged employees, and a significant loss on your hiring investment. The initial experience new hires have sets the tone for their entire tenure and heavily influences their decision to stay and thrive.</p>

            <h3>The Core of the Problem</h3>
            <p>A broken onboarding process typically involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lack of Pre-Joining Engagement:</strong> New hires feel forgotten between offer acceptance and their start date.</li>
                <li><strong>Paperwork Overload on Day One:</strong> Spending the first days buried in administrative tasks instead of engaging with the team or role.</li>
                <li><strong>No Clear Roadmap:</strong> New hires lack understanding of their initial priorities, goals, or who to go to for help.</li>
                <li><strong>Insufficient Support:</strong> Absence of a buddy system, mentor, or clear points of contact for questions.</li>
                <li><strong>Culture Shock:</strong> Not adequately preparing new hires for the company culture or norms.</li>
                <li><strong>Disconnected from Team:</strong> Feeling isolated or not properly introduced to colleagues and their roles.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Impact on Your Organization</h3>
            <p>The consequences of poor onboarding are costly and disruptive:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early Attrition:</strong> New hires are significantly more likely to leave within the first few months if onboarding is poor, leading to costly re-hiring.</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Productivity:</strong> New employees take longer to become fully productive, impacting team output and project timelines.</li>
                <li><strong>Damaged Employer Brand:</strong> A negative onboarding experience can lead to poor reviews and deter future applicants.</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of Investment:</strong> The time and money spent on recruiting are wasted if a new hire quickly leaves.</li>
                <li><strong>Lower Employee Morale:</strong> Frustrated new hires can negatively impact the morale of existing team members.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal & Compliance Risks:</strong> Failure to properly onboard can lead to compliance issues if essential training or policies are missed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Traditional (Often Ineffective) Solutions</h3>
            <p>Companies often attempt to address this by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Handing new hires a stack of manuals on their first day.</li>
                <li>Relying solely on the hiring manager to onboard, often without formal training or resources.</li>
                <li>Focusing only on technical training, neglecting cultural or administrative integration.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These reactive and uncoordinated efforts fail to create a truly welcoming and productive experience.</p>

            </ul>
